# Ubuntu-Font-Vinaooo
A simple Magisk Module to install Ubuntu Font on Android.
At this point, all I've done is a big mix of these projects, but i promise to research, improve and maintain this project alive.

This is based in 3 awesome projects:

 1. https://design.ubuntu.com/font
 2. https://forum.xda-developers.com/t/magisk-ubuntu-font-for-android.4096011/
 3. https://github.com/velitasali/ubuntu-font-android

# Supported systems:

 - LineageOS 20 - Android 13 (My own device)
 - Supposedly any AOSP version using Roboto in 

# Known bugs

 - The font weight doesn't show properly on some screen due to differences between Ubuntu Font and Roboto Font.

To be honest I never saw this bug, but it was inherited from one of the [projects](https://forum.xda-developers.com/t/magisk-ubuntu-font-for-android.4096011/) that inspired this module, so it may be present, however the [other project](https://github.com/velitasali/ubuntu-font-android) that inspired the module, supposedly fixed some bugs in Ubuntu Fonts and may have solved the problem .


# Motivations
I really love [Ubuntu Fonts](https://design.ubuntu.com/font) so i didn't found a simple module to put it in Android.
