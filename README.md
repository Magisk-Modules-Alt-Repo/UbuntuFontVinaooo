# Ubuntu-Font-Vinaooo
Check out this awesome Magisk Module that installs the popular Ubuntu font on your Android device! It's simple and easy to use. I promise you to continuously research, improve and maintain this project to keep it alive.

This project is based in 3 awesome projects:

 1. https://design.ubuntu.com/font
 2. https://forum.xda-developers.com/t/magisk-ubuntu-font-for-android.4096011/
 3. https://github.com/velitasali/ubuntu-font-android

# What's this?
This is a Magisk module. Magisk is a popular tool for rooting and modifying Android devices. It uses a systemless root method, which allows users to gain root access without modifying the system partition directly. One of the key features of Magisk is the ability to install custom modules, which can add various customizations or features to the device. Overall, Magisk provides a flexible and customizable way to modify and enhance Android devices.

# Supported systems:

 - LineageOS 20 - Android 13 (My own device)

Inherited from preceded projects:
 - NitrogenOS - Android 11
 - Havoc-OS 4.9 - Android 11
 - Supposedly any AOSP version using Roboto Fonts

# Known bugs

 - The font weight doesn't show properly on some screen due to differences between Ubuntu Font and Roboto Font.

To be honest I never saw this bug, but it was inherited from one of the [projects](https://forum.xda-developers.com/t/magisk-ubuntu-font-for-android.4096011/) that preceded this module, so it may be present, however the [other project](https://github.com/velitasali/ubuntu-font-android) that preceded the module, supposedly fixed some bugs in Ubuntu Fonts and may have solved the problem .


# Motivations
I really love [Ubuntu Fonts](https://design.ubuntu.com/font), I put it everywhere I can, and I didn't found a simple module to put it in my phone.
