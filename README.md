# Ubuntu-Font-Vinaooo
A simple Magisk Module to install Ubuntu Font on Android

This is based in 2 awesome projects:

 1. 
 2. https://forum.xda-developers.com/t/magisk-ubuntu-font-for-android.4096011/
 3. https://github.com/velitasali/ubuntu-font-android
 


# Known bugs

 - The font weight doesn't show properly on some screen due to differences between Ubuntu Font and Roboto Font.

To be honest I never saw this bug, but it was inherited from one of the [projects](https://forum.xda-developers.com/t/magisk-ubuntu-font-for-android.4096011/) that inspired this module, so it may be present, however the [other project](https://github.com/velitasali/ubuntu-font-android) that inspired the module, supposedly fixed some bugs in Ubuntu Font and may have solved the problem .
